# Predicting-the-Quality-of-Red-Wine-Using-Classification-Algorithms
Wine is a quite popular drink all over the world among different age group of peoples. It is an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes and many other chemicals are involved in the process of wine making. In this study, Various supervised classification oracle machine learning algorithms have been applied on the dataset of red wine to predict their quality based on the presence of different chemical components labeled in the used dataset. The result shows that despite of applying different unique algorithms such as: Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression, the accuracy diverges a little.
